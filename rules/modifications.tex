This is an \textit{optional} set of rules suggested by the community for more balanced and fun game.

\subsection*{Mage guild}

The Mage Guild has the following abilities:

\textbf{When built:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Search (2)} \svg{spellpower} twice \\ \textit{(same as the original action)}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{After built:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \svg{pay_v2} 5 \svg{gold} to \textbf{Search (2)} \svg{spellpower} \\ \textit{(same as the original action but with the same price for all factions)}.
    \item Remove a spell card from your hand to \textbf{Search (2)} \svg{spellpower} \\ \textit{(new action)}
\end{itemize}

Mage guild actions follow the standard rules - you need to flip \textbf{Spell Book Token} to perform them.

\subsection*{Combat Time Limits}

Combat against Neutral Units \textbf{doesn't} have any time limit. You don't have to spend 1 MP to play another combat round.

\subsection*{Card changes}

\textbf{Wisdom}

The cost of buying spells in your Town is reduced by 3. When obtaining spells from your Mage Guild, 
do \textbf{Search (3)} instead of \textbf{Search (2)}.

\svg{expert} The cost of buying spells in your Town is reduced to 0. When obtaining spells from your Mage Guild, 
do \textbf{Search (4)} instead of \textbf{Search (2)}.

\subsection*{Morale during combat}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \svg{morale_positive} After your unit has finished its turn, roll both attack dice. On 2x \textbf{+1} the unit activates again.
    There is no additional morale roll after the second activation.
    \item \svg{morale_negative} Before your unit activates, roll both attack dice. On 2x \textbf{--1}, the unit skips its activation this combat round.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Mutually exclusive effects}

If any two cards have effects that are mutually exclusive, they cancel each other out.

Consider Crusaders and Dread Knights in combat:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Crusaders}: \svg{unit_passive} During any attack, roll \textbf{2 Attack dice} and resolve the \textbf{higher} outcome.
    \item \textbf{Dread Knights}: \svg{unit_attack} When retaliating after this attack, the enemy rolls \textbf{2 Attack dice} and resolves the \textbf{lower} result.
\end{itemize}

So whenever Dread Knights attack Crusaders, their abilities cancel each other out and when Crusaders are about to relatiate, 
they roll 1 Attack die and resolve it as usual.
