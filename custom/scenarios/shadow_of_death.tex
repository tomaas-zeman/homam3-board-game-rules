\end{center}


\subsection*{\MakeUppercase{Plans...}}

At last! You have the Cloak of the Undead King and the Armor of the Damned! Your plans to take over Deyja, the undead nation populated by other Necromancers, can now commence! Ethric, your old master, became furious when he received word you became a Necromancer. When he learns about your plans with these two artifacts, he will be absolutely livid!

You have also learned Ethric has spread word of your whereabouts to those who lost these two precious artifacts and to others who have their own reasons for despising Necromancers. Your journey to Deyja might have a difficult start, so you send a party of scouts ahead to search for any signs of an ambush.


\subsection*{\MakeUppercase{Letter from Jeddite}}

You have just received a threatening letter from the Barbarians due west. It reads:

\begin{itshape}
"Sandro,

My name is Jeddite. Perhaps you remember me, if your memories are not clouded by your undead mind. We were students together under Ethric. By becoming Necromancer, you have completely shamed me, for it was I who introduced you to Ethric. I should have listened to him. From the start, he doubted your ability to wisely endure the burden of magical knowledge.

Ethric told me of the two artifacts now in your possession. Know this, Sandro: you will not get past me on your journey to Deyja. I have allied with the Rampart town up north, and they stand with me against you. I will take the artifacts from your rotting corpse and return them to Ethric."
\end{itshape}

You do remember this Jeddite. Not only was he one of Ethric's best students, he was also your best friend. So, he feels guilty for introducing you to Ethric. You will have to find a way use this weakness against him.


\subsection*{\MakeUppercase{Reply to Jeddite}}

Your advisors remind you it has been almost a week since you received that threatening letter from your old friend. They suggest you reply to it soon if you are to use your friendship to your advantage. You order for a messenger: "Deliver this message to Jeddite".

\begin{itshape}
"I have received your letter of warning. Am I suppose run and hide, fearful of your vow to stop me? No, your threat only strengthens my resolve. I will take these artifacts to Deyja, where I shall use them rise to the top of the Deyja hierarchy. You and your pitiful little band cannot stop me. If you stand in my way, I will kill every living soul under your command and convert their undead bodies to my cause. By the way, thank you for introducing me to the powers of magic. Without your help, I would never have achieved such greatness."
\end{itshape}

The messenger quickly writes your message onto a scroll and goes on his way. You wonder to yourself if the message was perhaps a little too confident. But, hopefully, giving him a glimpse of the monster he helped to create will shatter his own confidence.


\subsection*{\MakeUppercase{Letters to enemies}}

Sending a message confidently announcing your intentions to your enemy is not normally your approach. You prefer a deceitful manipulation or a surprise attack to the chivalry of civilized warfare. However, you are paying your advisors a large sum of gold to reveal your enemies' weaknesses to you, and they advise you thusly: "Send a message to all towns in this area announcing you hold the artifacts. Then explain with excruciating detail just how terribly powerful you will become when you use them. Tell them if they don't permit you to pass, you will use the artifacts in battle and cast the shadow of death over their land."

You agree that the announcement will at the very least shake your enemy's confidence and perhaps even delay them with debate so that you can continue your journey into Deyja. If the message fails to deter them from blocking your passage, then you can always fall back on the more sinister methods of persuasion you prefer. After several hours of rough drafts and wine goblets, you finally settle upon the final wording to be sent at the next dawn.


\subsection*{\MakeUppercase{Everyone knows}}

By now, all the fools standing between you and Deyja know about carry the artifacts you carry; however, there has been no official response to your message. This could mean a few things: they are quietly preparing a surprise attack; they don't believe you are a threat worthy of serious consideration, or they are a very weak and easily frightened people. You suspect that latter explanation and wonder what Ethric was thinking when he enlisted these people in his cause.


\subsection*{\MakeUppercase{The road is free}}

... text that there were no reinforcements from Jeddite ...

\textcolor{darkcandyapplered}{Choose award ...}


\subsection*{\MakeUppercase{Hostile infestation}}

Your spies sent a message you received this morning:

\begin{itshape}
"My Sovereign,

As difficult as our travels may be now, we don't foresee them getting any easier. We have learned desert surrounds our base of operations. This desert is infested with hostile creatures guarding all mines, taverns and anything else they can lay claim to. Our enemies have great numbers with many heroes to command them. You must travel very carefully and be prepared for battle at all times."
\end{itshape}

\textcolor{darkcandyapplered}{}

\subsection*{\MakeUppercase{Rumors}}

A spy returns with word has come about internal conflicts among your enemies. Your old friend Jeddite and his allies want to seize the artifacts and promptly return them to Ethric. However, two other allied stronghold towns to the North and to the Northeast want the artifacts to remain in their possession. According to you advisors, Lord Jabarkas, the leader of these two towns, is Ethric's illegitimate younger brother suffers from Little Man's Syndrome. It seems that Jabarkas has always been envious of his older brother's prestige, and you suspect that he believes he can gain more respect from his peers were he to have the two artifacts.
You permit yourself a sinister smile. Psychological attacks are the kind you enjoy most. With any luck, your enemies might just kill each other off, and you can pass through to Deyja like a shadow in the night."


\subsection*{\MakeUppercase{Assasination attempt}}

"Dreadful news, sir!" A soldier frantically runs up to you and tells you that someone broke into your quarters, slashed your linens, and drove a large sword through the middle of you bed. Attached was a note saying, "Sandro, death to you and all who would follow you. I will seize those artifacts you have stolen." The note was unsigned.
"Sir, I'm sorry to report that the intruder, whoever it was, came and went undetected," the soldier continues. "And the news gets worse, sir. The intruder took your hidden gold --. all of it. A thousand apologies, sir."

With a snarl, you raise your sword and lop off the soldier's head. You could have been assassinated had you slept in your bed last night. Your troops need to be better trained in the art of defending against covert attacks.
