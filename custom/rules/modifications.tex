This is an \textit{optional} set of rules suggested by the community for more balanced and fun game.

\subsection*{Mage guild}

The mage guild has the following abilities:

\textbf{When built:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Search (2)} {\spellpower} twice \\ \textit{(same as the original action)}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{After built:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item {\pay} 5 {\gold} to \textbf{Search (2)} \spellpower \\ \textit{(same as the original action but with the same price for all factions)}.
    \item Remove a spell card from your hand to \textbf{Search (2)} {\spellpower} \\ \textit{(new action)}
\end{itemize}

Mage guild actions follow the standard rules - you need to flip \textbf{Spell Book Token} to perform them.

\subsection*{Combat Time Limits}

Combat against Neutral Units \textbf{doesn't} have any time limit. You don't have to spend 1 MP to play another combat round.
